# Display-Test
A small app I wrote to test a whole bunch of LCD and Plasma Panels

This application uses 12 keyboard buttons:

ESC = exit fullscreen mode and hide the graphics area

TAB = Toggle colour values in graphics area

Q = increase RED value

W = increase GREEN value

E = increase BLUE value

A = decrease RED value

S = decrease GREEN value

D = decrease BLUE value

F = Cycle Colours (Black, Red, Green, Blue, White) in order

R = Random Colours

T = Increase Timer Ticks per Second

G = Decrease Timer Ticks Per Second



This application was written by DrToxic, and is used to aid the detection of dead or stuck pixles on an LCD display.
